## Description

The infinite monkey theorem states that if we put an immortal monkey in front of a typewriter, the monkey would finally and after the passage of a certain time, begin to pound the keys. The monkey would begin to "write" an infinite string of characters. By the fact of being infinite, we can affirm almost certainly, that somewhere in that infinity of letters, there will be some word written perfectly. Generally, it is often said that you could find the book of The Bible itself to the letter. Thanks to computation, this paradox is no longer so far away, and that is, we can assign a number to each letter, and obtain an infinite string in the number pi. To be able to affirm with total certainty that after the decimal nº 132.755.823.129 of the number pi, your name and surname appear, seems amazing to me. Who knows if the complete history of the universe has already been written about the number π?
